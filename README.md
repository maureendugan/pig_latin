This is an epicodus assignment

Ready for something a little harder? Write a Pig Latin translator. Here are the rules of Pig Latin:

For words that start with a vowel, add "ay" to the end.
For words that start with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add "ay". (If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where the "qu" doesn't come first!)
For words that start with "y", treat the "y" as a consonant.
Remember to break this down into small tests. When you get to consonants, don't try to solve it all at once. Instead, start with an example of a word that only has one consonant; then a word with two consonants; then a word with three; and then tackle "qu" and "y".

The .slice() method for strings may come in handy.

Once you have it working for one word, get it working for sentences.

And if you finish all of this, read about regular expressions and refactor your code to use them.
